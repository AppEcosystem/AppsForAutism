Through routine learning, children learn labeling of concepts.  WH ?'s require incorporating more abstract thought and generalization in regard to the learned concepts.  Children with Autism often have difficulty with this particular skill, and Autism iHelp - WH?'s apps are an excellent way to target a vital educational benchmark in a mobile capacity.  \nAdditionally, you are able to track your child's gains through progress reports that average the last 3 performances of each learning enhancement activity.\n\n “with Autism iHelp…..it gets better.”", "artistId":502389200, "artistName":"John Talavera", "genres":["Education"], "price":0.00, "bundleId":"com.jt.wh", "trackId":557548372, "trackName":"Autism iHelp – WH Questions", "releaseDate":"2012-09-18T13:21:21Z", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "minimumOsVersion":"5.0", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2014-08-01T21:50:19Z", "releaseNotes":"- iOS7 support\n- minor bug fixes", "primaryGenreId":6017, "formattedPrice":"Free", "sellerName":"John Talavera", "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":80},
